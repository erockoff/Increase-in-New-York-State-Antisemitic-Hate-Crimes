<h1><p>October 7 Attack on Israel Reflective of New York State Spike in Antisemitic Hate Crimes<p></h1>

<h2><p>Recent findings from the Division of Criminal Justice Services and the NYPD exhibit an upward trend in antisemitic hate crimes and why that disturbs Syracuse's Jewish community.</p></h2>

<p>On October 7, 2023, Jews around the world reeled as Israel was attacked by the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas – marking the most deadly day for Jews since the Holocaust. Once the initial assault finished, Jews did not find themselves receiving the global sympathy they were hoping for and deserved in the wake of a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>While the attack and its aftermath were shocking and disturbing, this kind of antisemitic escalation is unsurprising and inevitable, as reflected in recent data from New York State reports.</p> 

<p>21% of all American Jews reside in New York, which globally, makes it the most populous Jewish state after Israel. The total population of NYS is 11% Jewish, and New York City’s population is even more concentrated, at 18% Jewish.
</p>

<p>With this density comes high levels of hate crimes. In both New York State and New York City, antisemitic incidents have increased every year since 2019. While the data from non-New York City 2022 is preliminary, it is on track to exceed the 2019 total of 102 incidents in a year, as 2022’s partial total is already recorded at 98. New York City Police Department’s (NYPD) data further supports this projection, as their finalized total for 2022 is 277 antisemitic hate crimes – the highest of the four consecutive years measured.</p>

<p>Hate crime levels do decrease in 2020, but that can be attributed to the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns, rather than a decline in antisemitic attitudes. In fact, 2020 experienced decreased levels in almost all crime categories.

<p>To contextualize these figures within hate crime data at large, according to the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), antisemitic incidents comprise 87% of all religious hate crimes in New York State (Averaged totals from 2019-2022). This category includes offenses against Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Hindu, and Sikh persons.</p>

<p>In terms of mainstream antisemitism, its prevalence has wavered, but why have these numbers increased since 2019?
</p>

<p>The director of Syracuse University’s Jewish Studies Program, Professor Zachary Braiterman, believes these patterns can be traced back to the birth of Trump’s extremism and right-winged dogma.</p>

<p>He says, “All this crazy stuff that's coming out of the Republican Party – I think that makes a huge impact…QAnon is arguably antisemitic. When Donald Trump was retweeting Neo-Nazis. I think that made a huge difference.”</p>

<p>With a president whose irreverence towards antisemitism enabled the 2017 Charlottesville protest and the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, this upward trend is expected. A 2023 study done by the American Defamation League (ADL) corroborates Braiterman’s account. According to the ADL, 20% of Americans are likely to endorse more than 55% of antisemitic/anti-Israel tropes than in decades prior.</p>

<p>With such figures rising and a war raging in the Middle East, American Jews have become targets of domestic antisemitism and “responsible” for the happenings in Israel. Jews’ multi-thousand-year history of oppression and diaspora has made the Jewish identity complex and fickle.</p>

<p>Braiterman says, “It’s a really an uncomfortable thing because for most American Jews, Israel plays some part in their own Jewish identity, so expressions of criticism against Israel are seen as antisemitic and anti-Jewish.”</p>

<p>He continues, “The question, then, is when Israel is demonized as such: When people say, ‘Oh, Israel doesn't have a right to exist.’…criticism of Israel is a slippery slope to saying nasty, shitty things about Jews in Israel.”</p>

<p>This “slippery slope” is especially prevalent on college campuses – even at Syracuse University, whose undergraduate population is 18% Jewish, a relatively high percentage.</p>

<p>While Syracuse University Department of Public Safety declined to comment, their communications manager, Alexander Haessig, forwarded a statement regarding an antisemitic incident at Bird Library on December 5, 2023.</p>

<p>Craig Stone, DPS chief and associate vice president, says, “Given the current climate, it is imperative for us to swiftly investigate all reports of potentially hateful conduct.”</p>

<p>This affirmative stance is what Jewish communities need from their leaders. Not only is antisemitism increasing at the metropolitan and state levels – DPS reports exhibit that SU’s campus community is a microcosm of the larger trends described by the NYPD and DCJS data. With such wide-reaching spikes, it is imperative that measures are taken to mitigate the imminent damage of these figures climbing even higher.</p>
